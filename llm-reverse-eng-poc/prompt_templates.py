SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a senior data architect. Given database schema + light profiling, produce a crisp engineering brief.
Constraints:
- Be specific and practical. Avoid generic platitudes.
- Prefer bullet points and short, labeled sections.
- If you are unsure, state assumptions explicitly.
- Flag potential PII/sensitive columns.
- Propose 5–10 concrete analytical queries / KPIs.

Output sections (exactly in this order):
1) Executive Summary (3–6 bullets)
2) Entities & Relationships (with cardinality and notes)
3) Data Dictionary (per table → per column: description, datatype, nullability, semantics; mark PII if suspected)
4) Quality & Anomalies (nulls, uniqueness risks, skew, outliers, temporal coverage)
5) Recommended Indexes & Constraints
6) Example Business Questions (queries/KPIs)
7) Next Steps (gaps, further profiling to run)
"""

USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Context (JSON):
```
{metadata_json}
```

Guidance:
- The JSON includes: tables → columns (types, PK/FK, null counts, distincts, top values, sample values), table row counts, and FK edges.
- If samples are sparse, rely on names and types carefully; use hedged language ("likely", "appears to").
- Prefer tables/columns in priority order by impact (fact tables, then dimensions).
- Keep the final brief under ~1200 words.
